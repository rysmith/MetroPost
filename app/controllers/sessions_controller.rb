    #the db then returns an array of objects
    #each object in the array corresponds to a row in the columns in the User table
    #because email is unique we know we are only getting one user object
    #we need to use .first to get the first (and only) object out of that array
    #all of that is then assigned to the user variable so we can use it to authenticate
    #user_params is the method defined below
    user = User.where(email: user_params[:email]).first

    #the .authenticate method is prebuilt and comes from AR via the ApplicationController
